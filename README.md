# odin-recipes
Project 1 of the odin project
I guess it's a recipe website with no ccs but 
we learned about git, github, terminal commands, xubuntu,
vscode, and basic html.


First recipe is Cookies
2nd recipe is chocoulate fudge. 
third recipe is grilled cheese 
I've been using git commands like git status to see the status of my program, git add --all to add all my files to be staged and git commit -m "comment" to allow it to be ready for my git push command which sends it to my github account
