        <p>A grilled cheese sandwich is assembled by creating a cheese
            filling, often cheddar, or American, between two slices of
            bread, and is then heated until the bread browns and the
            cheese melts. A layer of butter or mayonnaise is sometimes
            added to the outside of the bread for additional flavor
            and texture.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter or margarine</li>
            <li>4 slices white bread</li>
            <li>2 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>1 roma(plum) tomato, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno pepper, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over low heat. Spread butter or
                margarine onto one side of two slices of bread.
                Place both pieces buttered side down in the skillet.
                Lay a slice of cheese on each one, and top with slices of tomato,
                onion and jalapeno. Butter one side of the remaining slices of bread,
                and place on top buttered side up. When the bottom of the sandwiches
                are toasted, flip and fry until brown on the other side.</li>
