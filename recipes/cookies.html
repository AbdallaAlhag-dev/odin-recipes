        <p>A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features 
            chocolate chips or chocolate morsels as its distinguishing ingredient. 
            Chocolate chip cookies originated in the United States around 1938, 
            when Ruth Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestl√© semi-sweet chocolate bar
             and added the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe.</p>
